# Digital-Lock
Arduino Project in Embedded Systems

This project presents the design and implementation of an embedded digital combination lock 
system utilizing the Arduino microcontroller. Digital combination locks are essential electronic security 
devices employed to restrict access to systems until a specific, validated numeric sequence is correctly 
provided. This system leverages a 4x4 matrix keypad for user input and employs EEPROM (Electrically 
Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) for the persistent, non-volatile storage of the secret access 
code, enabling robust security and dynamic code management. 
The core operational principles involve continuous keypad scanning, the execution of 
sophisticated embedded security logic for input validation, and precise output control via a two-channel 
relay module. Real-time user feedback is provided through an integrated LCD screen, a buzzer, and 
dual LED indicators. Notably, the system incorporates a thematic simulation—emulating a Counter
Strike 2 C4 bomb—to enhance engagement. A successful code entry triggers the green LED and a 
distinct success tone, signifying system disarming, while code failure or timer expiration activates the 
red LED and a prolonged alarm sound, displaying the message "!!! EXPLODED !!!". This integrated 
embedded system serves as both a functional access control prototype and an effective educational 
model for demonstrating fundamental concepts in digital security, input-output interfacing, and 
controlled actuation.
